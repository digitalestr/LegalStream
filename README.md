<h1>LegalStream</h1>
An m3u8 playlist featuring many LEGALLY FREE IPTV streams. For use with VLC.

I now have packages, allowing you to mix and match channel genres, allowing you to have only the channels YOU want in your lineup.

<h1>IMPORTANT: This repo is deprecated!</h1>
Due to other interests, I am official deprecating this repo. I really appreciate the overwhelming support this has gotten over the years, but due to a lack of interest, the massively transcient nature of live stream URLs today, and the increasing scope of the project, I can no longer maintain it. If someone wishes to revive the project (as I hope someone does), please reach out, as I would love to be an occaisional contributor to the spiritual successor when I have the time/motivation, even though I don't have the energy to lead the project again.
